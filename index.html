      <h2>About</h2>

     <p>This website looks into instances of internalization of the colonial logic within the colonized populaces across the several colonial projects carried out by European nations (especially the British) across the African continent and South Asia, primarily the Indian subcontinent. The themes that I will be focusing on as spaces for said internalization are religion (specifically Christianity), the English language, and the different attitudes of the colonizer to the colonized culture compared to the accounts of colonial culture as noted by the "anglicized" natives of the colonized lands. </p>
   <p>When we think of the colonialism, or the colonial time period in this supposed post-colonial world, the most prominent story that comes to the foreground is that of oppression and subjugation by the colonizers and accounts of struggle, resistance and eventual liberation from the colonizers by the former colonies. Rightly so, as the stories of resistance form the most important rhetoric that need to be the most prominently remembered from the history of colonialism. What this project aims to do however, is to explore the other side of the dynamic between colonizer and colonized, by looking at and analyzing accounts of and stories by colonized people who had been attracted to western religion and language after the imposition of said language and religious practices on to the colonized spaces by the colonial education, administrative and religious institutions. </p>
   <p>All the primary texts that are used for this project have been gathered from <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/index.html">One More Voice.</a> </p>

   <h2> Mission Sattement and Acknowledgement</h2>
  <p> This digital project aims to look into the perpetuation and internalization of the colonial/imperialistic logic/rhetoric among colonized people. I think this is important to explore and analyze as the effects of said internalization can be seen today in several instances all across the world and especially in formerly colonized nations, through the cultural, religious, economic and clothing practices as well as through the centrality English to the conception of "world literature(s)".</p>

<p>As this is a critical exploration of imperialistic attitudes and tendencies in the form of a Digital Humanities project, I need to be aware of not repeating the imperialistic traditions of exclusivity, mystification, and lack of acknowledgement while creating the digital project. For this purpose, I have three primary goals in mind while constructing this project:</p>

<p>Accessibility: I will try to ensure the complete accessibility of the project for all users, by eliminating exclusivity barriers in the form of paywalls. For this purpose, I need to make sure that the website remains open access in the long term, and the idea of minimal computing through the use of CSS and Oxygen XML platforms to create the website from the ground up, to the best of my abilities, serves this purpose. </p>

<p>Transparency: I also recognize the need for the user to be able to retrace the steps taken by the project developers to form a critical understanding regarding a topic. This is important so that the user can do a background check themselves on the information the project uses to form the viewpoint they come to, so that the user can critically think and form their own perspectives regarding the issue or topic at hand and not solely have to rely on the websiteâ€™s viewpoint. For this purpose, I will provide all the citational information on the sources I use for the project and make sure they are all accessible, open sources. </p>

<p>Acknowledgement: One of the primary representational aspects of colonial/imperialistic knowledge formations regarding the colonized people, land and cultures was the lack of acknowledgement given to the indigenous sources they gathered their information from, and interpreting said knowledge based on the western cultural context. </p>

<p>In an attempt to not repeat the same trajectory for this project, I plan to acknowledge all collaborators, from Dr. Wisnicki, without whom this whole project would not be possible, all my classmates whose valuable input in the form of ideas brought up during in-class discussions and feedback on my project as it continues to develop has been indispensable, to all those whose technical expertise I will be reliant on as the project enters the developmental phase, and One More Voice, created by Dr. Wisnicki, which is the source of all the primary texts on which this project is based, and the sources from which I derive my critical understanding regarding the topic. </p>
