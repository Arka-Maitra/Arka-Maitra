      <h2>About</h2>

     <p>This website looks into instances of internalization of the colonial logic within the colonized populaces across the several colonial projects carried out by European nations (especially the British) across the African continent and South Asia, primarily the Indian subcontinent. The themes that I will be focusing on as spaces for said internalization are religion (specifically Christianity), the English language, and the different attitudes of the colonizer to the colonized culture compared to the accounts of colonial culture as noted by the "anglicized" natives of the colonized lands. </p>
   <p>When we think of the colonialism, or the colonial time period in this supposed post-colonial world, the most prominent story that comes to the foreground is that of oppression and subjugation by the colonizers and accounts of struggle, resistance and eventual liberation from the colonizers by the former colonies. Rightly so, as the stories of resistance form the most important rhetoric that need to be the most prominently remembered from the history of colonialism. What this project aims to do however, is to explore the other side of the dynamic between colonizer and colonized, by looking at and analyzing accounts of and stories by colonized people who had been attracted to western religion and language after the imposition of said language and religious practices on to the colonized spaces by the colonial education, administrative and religious institutions. </p>

   <h2> Mission Statement</h2>
  <p> This digital project aims to look into the perpetuation and internalization of the colonial/imperialistic logic/rhetoric among colonized people. I think this is important to explore and analyze as the effects of said internalization can be seen today in several instances all across the world and especially in formerly colonized nations, through the cultural, religious, economic and clothing practices as well as through the centrality English to the conception of "world literature(s)".</p>

<p>As this is a critical exploration of imperialistic attitudes and tendencies in the form of a Digital Humanities project, I need to be aware of not repeating the imperialistic traditions of exclusivity, mystification, and lack of acknowledgement while creating the digital project. For this purpose, I have three primary goals in mind while constructing this project:</p>

<p>Accessibility: I will try to ensure the complete accessibility of the project for all users, by eliminating exclusivity barriers in the form of paywalls. For this purpose, I need to make sure that the website remains open access in the long term, and the idea of minimal computing through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript platforms to create the website from the ground up, to the best of my abilities, serves this purpose. </p>

<p>Transparency: I also recognize the need for the user to be able to retrace the steps taken by the project developers to form a critical understanding regarding a topic. This is important so that the user can do a background check themselves on the information the project uses to form the viewpoint they come to, so that the user can critically think and form their own perspectives regarding the issue or topic at hand and not solely have to rely on the website’s viewpoint. For this purpose, I will provide all the citational information on the sources I use for the project and make sure they are all accessible, open sources. </p>

<p>Acknowledgement: One of the primary representational aspects of colonial/imperialistic knowledge formations regarding the colonized people, land and cultures was the lack of acknowledgement given to the indigenous sources they gathered their information from, and interpreting said knowledge based on the western cultural context. </p>

<p>In an attempt to not repeat the same trajectory for this project, I acknowledge all collaborators who helped in the creation of this project. I wish to acknowledge Dr. Wisnicki, without whom this whole project would not be possible, all my classmates whose valuable input in the form of ideas brought up during in-class discussions and feedback on my project as it continues to develop has been indispensable, and all those whose technical expertise I was reliant on for the development and coding of the webpage, and One More Voice, created by Dr. Wisnicki, which is the source of all the primary texts on which this project is based, and the sources from which I derive my critical understanding regarding the topic. </p>

   <h2> Religion as a Colonizing Tool</h2>
   <p>
      Whenever a European nation state decided to take control over a nation for colonial purposes, they would try to get the colonized population on the side of the colonial administration to avoid issues of dissent, revolt or revolution against the usually oppressive colonial regime. One of the primary tools used by European colonial powers for this specific purpose, was religious conversion. But for this purpose, the previously existing religions and cultures needed to be systematically undermined, supressed, defaced and erased, this is where missionary work came in to play. Most of the colonial ships arriving on African, or Asian shores in the 17th 18th and 19th centuries, along with traders, administrators, soldiers, carried Christian missionaries. While the missionaries did humanitarian work for the people, it was mostly based on the concept of the “white man’s burden”, which was the belief among western European societies that during the era of enlightenment, they had achieved cultural, scientific and intellectual, and theological superiority, over all other cultures and peoples in existence and hence it was their “god given” duty to bring the rest of the “uncivilized” world into the light of western enlightenement thought and also, the light of Christianity. While this may sound magnanimous to some, it was tinged with an almost racist belief of undervaluing cultural values and was used as a justification for the colonial suppression. In the introduction to the paper titled “Missionary Colonial Mentality and the Expansion of Christianity in Bechuanaland Protectorate, 1800 to 1900”, the authors state, “… the LMS missionaries made the mistake of believing that to become a Christian, Batswana had to completely abandon their indigenous cultures. They treated African religions as evil and did everything  possible to ensure that it was ousted. The western missionaries believed that traditional religious beliefs and practices were inferior, and together with the traditional customs, had to be done away with before the acceptance of Christianity. However this was vehemently resisted.  (Nkomanzana, Doreen setume)
