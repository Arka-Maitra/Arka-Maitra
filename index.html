      <h2>About</h2>

     <p>This website looks into instances of internalization of the colonial logic within the colonized populaces across the several colonial projects carried out by European nations (especially the British) across the African continent and South Asia, primarily the Indian subcontinent. The themes that I will be focusing on as spaces for said internalization are religion (specifically Christianity), the English language, and the different attitudes of the colonizer to the colonized culture compared to the accounts of colonial culture as noted by the "anglicized" natives of the colonized lands. </p>
   <p>When we think of the colonialism, or the colonial time period in this supposed post-colonial world, the most prominent story that comes to the foreground is that of oppression and subjugation by the colonizers and accounts of struggle, resistance and eventual liberation from the colonizers by the former colonies. Rightly so, as the stories of resistance form the most important rhetoric that need to be the most prominently remembered from the history of colonialism. What this project aims to do however, is to explore the other side of the dynamic between colonizer and colonized, by looking at and analyzing accounts of and stories by colonized people who had been attracted to western religion and language after the imposition of said language and religious practices on to the colonized spaces by the colonial education, administrative and religious institutions. </p>

   <h2> Mission Statement</h2>
  <p> This digital projec?t aims to look into the perpetuation and internalization of the colonial/imperialistic logic/rhetoric among colonized people. I think this is important to explore and analyze as the effects of said internalization can be seen today in several instances all across the world and especially in formerly colonized nations, through the cultural, religious, economic and clothing practices as well as through the centrality English to the conception of "world literature(s)".</p>

<p>As this is a critical exploration of imperialistic attitudes and tendencies in the form of a Digital Humanities project, I need to be aware of not repeating the imperialistic traditions of exclusivity, mystification, and lack of acknowledgement while creating the digital project. For this purpose, I have three primary goals in mind while constructing this project:</p>

<p>Accessibility: I will try to ensure the complete accessibility of the project for all users, by eliminating exclusivity barriers in the form of paywalls. For this purpose, I need to make sure that the website remains open access in the long term, and the idea of minimal computing through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript platforms to create the website from the ground up, to the best of my abilities, serves this purpose. </p>

<p>Transparency: I also recognize the need for the user to be able to retrace the steps taken by the project developers to form a critical understanding regarding a topic. This is important so that the user can do a background check themselves on the information the project uses to form the viewpoint they come to, so that the user can critically think and form their own perspectives regarding the issue or topic at hand and not solely have to rely on the website’s viewpoint. For this purpose, I will provide all the citational information on the sources I use for the project and make sure they are all accessible, open sources. </p>

<p>Acknowledgement: One of the primary representational aspects of colonial/imperialistic knowledge formations regarding the colonized people, land and cultures was the lack of acknowledgement given to the indigenous sources they gathered their information from, and interpreting said knowledge based on the western cultural context. </p>

<p>In an attempt to not repeat the same trajectory for this project, I acknowledge all collaborators who helped in the creation of this project. I wish to acknowledge Dr. Wisnicki, without whom this whole project would not be possible, all my classmates whose valuable input in the form of ideas brought up during in-class discussions and feedback on my project as it continues to develop has been indispensable, and all those whose technical expertise I was reliant on for the development and coding of the webpage, and One More Voice, created by Dr. Wisnicki, which is the source of all the primary texts on which this project is based, and the sources from which I derive my critical understanding regarding the topic. </p>

   <h2>Religion and Colonialism</h2>
   <p>Usually when European nation states took control over another nation for colonial purposes, attempts would be made at assmilation of the colonized population into the colonial culture. In the examples we will look at below, we can see how said assimilation would complement and aid the supression and effacement of native socio-reiligious and cultural strucutres and avoid or minimize conflict against the oppressions of the colonial regime. One of the primary tools used by European colonial powers for this specific purpose, was religious conversion. For attepmts at esablishing Chirsitanity as a dominant religious belief wihtin the newly exposed populations to be succesful, a lot of times existing religions and cultures were systematically undermined, supressed, defaced and erased. Most of the colonial ships arriving on African, or Asian shores in the 17th 18th and 19th centuries, along with traders, administrators, military personnel, carried missionaries. While missionaries did humanitarian work for the people, it was mostly based on the concept of the “white man’s burden”, which was the belief among western European societies that during the era of enlightenment, they had achieved cultural, scientific, intellectual, and theological superiority, over all other cultures and peoples, and hence it was their “god given” duty to bring the rest of the “uncivilized” world into the light. While this may sound magnanimous, it was tinged with an almost racially inspired belief in the superiority of their cultural values and was used as a justification for the colonial suppression.</p>
 <P>In the introduction to the paper titled “Missionary Colonial Mentality and the Expansion of Christianity in Bechuanaland Protectorate, 1800 to 1900”, the authors state, “… the LMS missionaries made the mistake of believing that to become a Christian, Batswana had to completely abandon their indigenous cultures. They treated African religions as evil and did everything possible to ensure that it was ousted. The western missionaries believed that traditional religious beliefs and practices were inferior, and together with the traditional customs, had to be done away with before the acceptance of Christianity. However, this was vehemently resisted.” (Nkomanzana, Doreen Setume). The essay goes on to explore instances of how missionaries, through an innate sense of western superiority complex rejected to subscribe to any value in the centuries old culture of the Batswana people and made aggressive attempts to efface Batswana culture and anglicize its people completely so as to internalize the colonial rhetoric of western superiority among the native people. This was done to justify the colonial oppression and cultural erasure. It also made colonial endeavours smoother by having loyal anglicized native believers in the imperial cause, who would often times join the missionary cause and help spread the evangelical message. Accounts of such anglicization and conversion of colonized people can be found in literature from almost all regions affected by Western colonization. A periodical piece from One More Voice, <a href= “https://onemorevoice.org/html/bipoc-voices/digital-editions-amd/liv_026014_HTML.html”> “The Hindus”</a> is an example of one such instance of native missionary work. The first paragraph of the excerpt, by an anonymous author introduces the reader to  Gungaram, who is described as a “native teacher”(anonymous, Clarkson, Gungaram), and the following paragraph is presumably Gungaram’s speech, which he delivered while on a missionary tour in “Gujerat” with Rev W. Clarkson of the London Missionary Society, some time in 1852.<a href= “https://onemorevoice.org/html/bipoc-voices/digital-editions-amd/liv_026006_HTML.html”> “A Converted Brahmin’s Account of Himself”</a>, is an account by an anonymous author of the account by Narain Rao, from India, of his introduction to Christianity by both native and non-native missionaries during a time of personal struggle and vulnerability, and his eventual conversion to Christianity and acceptance of Christ. The language of this piece and especially the anonymous author of the introductory paragraph serves as examples of how the colonial/missionary project viewed any and all peoples from non-christian religions and cultures as “heathen” and “wanderer from God”. Both these instances are unique but similar examples of how a sense of cultural and socio-religious superiority is built into the religious rhetoric, the effectivity of which bases on the degradation and undermining of native culture. </p>  
<p>Divisions among native communities can be seen occurring based on religious lines as can be seen in instances in <a href= “https://onemorevoice.org/html/transcriptions/liv_020061_TEI.html”>“The History of Caras Farrar of finding Dr. Livingstone, in Central Africa”</a> where, based on the author’s description it can be seen how divisions among people from the same or neighbouring communities are based on their newly acquired religious allegiances, the author writes, “These men throughout the journey never associated with us six Christian boys their brothers as they have turned out Mohammedans.” (Anonymous, Farrar). Religious resentment can be seen as a natural consequence of cultural encroachment but this particular instance is interesting because it is not that the resentment is directed towards the encroacher from the point of one being encroached upon or vice versa, but rather in support of one newly acquired religion against another which can be seen in the use of the phrase “turned”, which I believe is a comment upon the newly converted nature and goes to show the degree of socio-religious displacement that has been internalized.</p>
<p>The missionary endeavours also usually went hand in hand with the larger colonial project, an excerpt from a Tanzanian radio commentary from July 1986, as reproduced in <a href= “https://www.jstor.org/stable/3099223?seq=2”>“Demythologising the Missionaries: A Reassessment of the Functions and Relationships of Christian Missionary Education under Colonialism”</a>, by Clayton G. Mackenzie says, “Mission schooling supported imperialism. We should remember not what they gave us but what they took away from us. Educating children is, in principle, fine and worthwhile. But there is a question to be asked: what were they being educated for? They were being educated for subservience, they were being educated to turn their backs on their own past and their own peoples.” (Mackenzie). As can be seen from this example and the previous quote from the essay by Nkomanzana and Setume, the indoctrination process had not always been one of passive acceptance and would be met with mistrust and resistance. </p>
<p>Mission schools were inspired by the same Christian enlightenment thought processes that inspired colonial and imperial endeavours, but the education and training received was not the problem as it did help develop thoughts and thinkers which would work as catalysts in both getting rid of some truly harmful social practices and in anticolonial struggles, as it gave the colonised people the necessary tools to deal with the colonizers on their own terms. In <a href= “https://archive.org/details/BokwalaTheStoryOfACongoVictim/Bokwala2/”> Bokwala the Story of a Congo Victim</a> Talks about the dichotomy of “white man” as “white men of god” talk of salvation and attempt to help but are ultimately within the confines of the larger colonial framework and hence unable to affect much change in the face of oppression by the “white man of rubber”. The problem though, as can be seen are two pronged,firstly as can be seen in instances like Bokwala, they  may have had evangelic inspirations, but were still subservient to the overall colonial cause and individual efforts would not go to lengths which would cause rifts with the colonial administration for the colonised people, people whom the preface to the book describes as being, “… for whose protection Great Britain and the United States of America have special responsibility before God and Men” and describes the colonial slavery that communities of the Congo  are being subjected to, as being “…reserved for ‘Christian Civilisation’ to introduce the system of atrocious oppression and hopeless despair..” (Bokwala, Guinness). Secondly,  mission schools, truly were spaces for Socio-religious and cultural effacement and indoctrination into a rhetoric of western superiority, as can be seen in an essay by Cyrelen Amoah Boampong, titled <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43855015?searchText=RETHINKING+BRITISH+COLONIAL+POLICY+IN+THE+GOLD+COAST+THE+LANGUAGE+FACTOR&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DRETHINKING%2BBRITISH%2BCOLONIAL%2BPOLICY%2BIN%2BTHE%2BGOLD%2BCOAST%253A%2BTHE%2BLANGUAGE%2BFACTOR&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A35f42f63b43d70ee3914eea1d3d84212&seq=6">"Rethinking British Colonial Policy in the Gold Coast: The Language Factor"</a>, the author explains "Provision of education primarily remained the preserve of the Christian missions... a clash of world views was inevitablegiven Christianity's frim stance on monotheism and its rejection of of every other religous expression as heathen... Nonethelesss, mission schools had a firm control on their educational curriculum. It comprised of reading, writing and religious instruction with the later addition of geography and grammar in the Cape Ccoast ccastle schools and arithmetic and manual labour by the Basel mission schools. However, the curriculum dsiregarded key aspects of Ghanian culture as manifestations of paganism. Thus, the Basel missionaries urged their students not to participate in activities ssuch as rites of passage ceremonies and to relocate to mission stations." (Boampong) </P>

      <h2> Language and Colonialism</h2>
      <p>Missionary schooling was primarily dependant around language training, and the missionary schools mostly incorporated their own language as the sole medium of communication within schools. An extract from the essay by Cyrelene Amoah Boampong, titled <a href= https://www.jstor.org/stable/43855015?searchText=RETHINKING+BRITISH+COLONIAL+POLICY+IN+THE+GOLD+COAST+THE+LANGUAGE+FACTOR&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DRETHINKING%2BBRITISH%2BCOLONIAL%2BPOLICY%2BIN%2BTHE%2BGOLD%2BCOAST%253A%2BTHE%2BLANGUAGE%2BFACTOR&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A35f42f63b43d70ee3914eea1d3d84212&seq=6> “Rethinking British Colonial Policy in the Gold Coast: The Language Factor”</a>, about the role of language within educational policies in pre-colonial and colonial Ghana, reads, “The seventeenth century witnessed the Dutch, Danes, French, and British involvement in the provision of western education in pre-colonial Ghana. The Dutch schools advanced the Christian faith and stressed proficiency in the Dutch language… The Danes picked up where the Dutch left off. In 1722 they established a school in the Christiansborg Castle… Castle schools provided the avenue for cross- cultural interaction which compounded the linguistic situation in the Gold Coast. The language taught in these castle schools was contingent on which European power established the school… Little regard was paid to the traditional system of education and its use of the vernacular… in 1821, the British government abolished the Company of Merchants and its forts were controlled by the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles McCarthy. McCarthy revived the Cape Coast school but placed it under the dominion of the British colonial government… From this point on, British influence on education was solidified. English became firmly established as the medium of instruction in the school at Cape Coast.” (Boampong). Despite this, the essay does mention that the native languages were the preferred medium for spreading “the good news” of Christianity among the colonised people, and that several mission schools, unlike the castle school did adopt the policy of spreading religious education in native languages initially. When the Gold Coast region was formally incorporated into British colonial rule, the language policy would oscillate between full implementation of the English language as the official state and administrative language as well as the sole medium of education, to pedagogy, especially Christian religious pedagogy practiced in native languages. But irrespective of the language implementational policies of the government, the motivation for switching around the language policies were always rooted in benefit of the colonizers. The missionary motivation behind the adoption of native languages as mediums of instruction was rooted in a need for spreading the word of Christianity to as many people as fast and efficiently as possible. Likewise, pushing for Anglicization of Official and administrative language practices helped create an English trained class of native administrative workers who would aid in the implementation of the colonial policies and the internalization within the colonized consciousness, of the colonial rhetoric.</p> 
      <p>Due to the internalization of the colonial rhetoric through processes of cultural assimilation, the Western European cultural capital was something that was widely desired within the public consciousnesses of several colonized communities. Boampong explores such a phenomenon phenomenon in the essay, when talking about the cultural assimilation and internalization of the colonial culture in Ghana; “… during the early stages of European intrusion into Africa, there was an ‘unbridled adoption’ of European lifestyle manifested in their language, dressing and other social aspects. This was the time when the policy of assimilation was at its peak and European culture was idealized to the detriment of Gold Coast culture; as colonial Ghanaians ‘uncritically mimicked” European lifestyle.” (Boampong). In this way we can see that the European cultural capital gained through adoption of language and lifestyle was something to be held in high regard, and the person who provided the native individual training in these fields, were held in extremely high regard, so much so that the now anglically trained individual would pledge their loyalty to their “master” from that moment onward. An example of such a scenario can be seen in the recovered text from the One More Voice repository, titled, <a href= https://onemorevoice.org/html/transcriptions/liv_020061_TEI.html> “The History of Caras Farrar of Finding Dr Livingstone, in Central Africa”</a>. In the following extract, the resentment held by the author Carras Farrar, towards his compatriots, for their disloyalty towards Dr. David Livingstone, in abandoning the Christian faith and way of life in-spite of the English language training they received from him can be read in the lines; “Chuma and Suse, in spite of all that the Dr. did for them in getting them English education at Dr. Wilson's School at Bombay have at last turned out Mohammedans also.” (Anonymous, Farrar). This instance displays both the value placed on receiving English language training and the greater sense of allegiance and loyalty ascribed by colonized individuals towards their colonial way of life and masters than their own people and community members. This can be read as examples of the degree of internalization of the colonial rhetoric within individuals from within the colonized communities.</p>  
<p>There are instances within the collections of One More Voice, of Anglicized, native scholars and teachers from various colonised communities attempting to translate and frame their own language within the framework of Anglo-European grammatical norms. For Example, <a href= https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044004547899&view=1up&seq=7> “Vocabulary of the Yoruba Language, to Which Are Prefixed the Grammatical Elements of the Language”</a> by Samuel Ayaji Crowther, is one such book which attempts to frame and translate the Yoruba language within the linguistic and grammatical framework of the English language. As we can understand, by looking at the later sections of the book, especially “Address to the Chiefs and People of Africa”, that the book had its allegiances with the colonial powers and was a believer in the superiority of the English culture and language. Works such as these would have played a role in familiarising the colonizers with both the culture and language of the colonized people. Irrespective of whether English and other European languages were imposed and native languages and cultures undermined and suppressed through cultural assimilation or whether they were incorporated into the working of the colonial machinery for its smoother functioning, one aspect which remained common throughout, was the colonized people’s complete lack of agency in decisions over the language they spoke. Language became another tool for the supplementation of the colonial project in various moments of subjugation, assimilation or appeasement of the colonized people, as was deemed beneficial for the Empire. </p>
