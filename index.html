 <p> <blockquote><h1>About:</h1></blockquote>
   <p> This website looks into instances of internalization of the colonial logic within the colonized populaces across the several colonial projects carried out by European nations (especially the British) across the African continent and South Asia, primarily the Indian subcontinent. The themes that I will be focusing on as spaces for said internalization are religion (specifically Christianity), the English language, and the different attitudes of the colonizer to the colonized culture compared to the accounts of colonial culture as noted by the "anglicized" natives of the colonized lands. </p>
   <p>When we think of the colonialism, or the colonial time period in this supposed post-colonial world, the most prominent story that comes to the foreground is that of oppression and subjugation by the colonizers and accounts of struggle, resistance and eventual liberation from the colonizers by the former colonies. Rightly so, as the stories of resistance form the most important rhetoric that need to be the most prominently remembered from the history of colonialism. What this project aims to do however, is to explore the other side of the dynamic between colonizer and colonized, by looking at and analyzing accounts of and stories by colonized people who had been attracted to western religion and language after the imposition of said language and religious practices on to the colonized spaces by the colonial education, administrative and religious institutions. All the primary texts that are used for this project have been gathered from One More Voice. </p>
